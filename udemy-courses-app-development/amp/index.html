It covers a wide range of topics but is mainly built around the importance of outsourcing properly, which the course instructor claims is where most budding appreneurs fail.</p><p>If the reviews are anything to go by, he is right since many people who have gone through the course claim they now understand where they went wrong before.

Students are taken from the basics such as creating shapes and text to more complex concepts such as data management, GPS and maps, capturing user input, and much more.</p><p>The course promises to give students the skills and tools they need to build commercial apps as simply and quickly as possible.</p><p>It doesn’t claim that an app can be created without any sort of coding, but it certainly does seem to give students the knowledge they require to use Corona SDK effectively to create apps. Furthermore, while a bit of effort is required, the knowledge gained gives students an edge if they wish to become truly successful appreneurs.</p><p>Another advantage of this course is that Corona SDK can be used to create apps that will work on any platform, including <a title="Android and iOS" href="http://www.bluelabellabs.com/">Android and iOS</a>, which ensures students aren’t limited in terms of the return on investment.</p><p>The course currently has 864 students enrolled in it and plenty of positive reviews. In fact, most students say that the video demonstrations are incredibly informative and the course so logically structured that anyone can learn how to develop an app using Corona SDK.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $99</p><h2><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kx0mrZUwI*k&amp;offerid=323058.28790&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fhtml5-mobile-app-development-with-phonegap%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HTML5 Mobile App Development with PhoneGap</a></h2><p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=kx0mrZUwI*k&amp;offerid=323058.28790&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fhtml5-mobile-app-development-with-phonegap%2F" target="_blank"><amp-img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13437 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.bluelabellabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/28790_5275_5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bluelabellabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/28790_5275_5.jpg 480w, https://www.bluelabellabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/28790_5275_5-250x141.jpg 250w, https://www.bluelabellabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/28790_5275_5-120x68.jpg 120w" width="480" height="270" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></a></p><p>The 933 students enrolled in this course are learning how to make dynamic mobile applications that will work on any platform using HTML5. Students are taught how to code a wide range of apps with features from the PhoneGap library. The advantage is that students can create applications with little to no knowledge of Java or Objective C. Students are able to learn how to create apps that can interact with a smartphone’s microphone and camera, as well as using remote data from a server, and learning how to control audio and video.</p><p>The course includes numerous hours of video lecture, but also lots of examples of code and applications, along with effective lab exercises that make it easier for students to grasp and retain the concepts.</p><p>In terms of reviews, it seems that users who are new to HTML, CSS and JavaScript found the course highly informative and effective. However, it appears that for anyone already familiar with these languages and who is solely looking to learn more about PhoneGap’s API, the content is rather limited. The reviews, though, are generally positive.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $99</p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/92605333@N00/8425378345/" target="_blank">hjl</a></em></p><div class="swp-content-locator"></div>	</div>
